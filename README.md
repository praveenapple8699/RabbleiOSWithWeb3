# RabbleiOS


1. I have implemented the Invite Code Screen fully in Swift programmatically without using nibs or storyboards.

2. I have tried to get myself faimiliarized with the telegram ios source code, but the project structure was too complex for me to modify and add additional code, I didnt know where to add the code to push the InviteCodeVC after the telgram login happened. I was not able to understand its architecture/structure of the project.

3. I have created a new project and implemented the UI and the mock API to check the success invite code and a basic client side validation before making the api call.

4. Regarding the Web3Auth SDK integration, I have gone through their website and documentaion, I created an free account and tried to run their sample project, but their own SDK was giving errors, the SDK's are not editable or debuggable and coudn't find a solution for this.

5. I am attaching a 2nd project with web3auth sdk added for you reference to see what are the issues that I am facing.

6. Please find the 2nd project named RabbleiOSWithWeb3 for your reference.
